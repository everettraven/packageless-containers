Welcome! Thanks for checking out the packageless-containers documentation!

The packageless-containers repository is a supporting repository that serves to store the Dockerfiles used to create container images that are used by packageless. All containers that live here are going to be temporarily maintained by the packageless team.

This repository is temporary as the long term goal is that developers will create container images and pim configurations specifically for use with packageless.

There isn't much to this repository other than the Dockerfiles, but you are welcome to contribute to this repository by following the [contributing guidlines](contributing.md)
